## Summary Findings

The dashboard presents website performance data for June 2023, displaying combined results from mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. Users have the flexibility to filter data based on specific devices and months as needed.

- In June 2023, there was a notable 13.1% increase in website visitors compared to the previous period, with a significant surge in new users by 12.4%. This increase suggests successful marketing campaigns or efforts to attract more visitors to the website, evidenced by the growing interest of new users. However, this increase was not accompanied by improved session duration and page views. Metrics like average session duration, average time on page, and pages per session declined, indicating that visitors explored fewer pages during each visit and spent less time on the website, possibly due to unengaging content or suboptimal user experience.

- The majority of website visitors were males aged between 25 and 34 years, and the top countries with the highest number of visitors included the US, Canada, India, UK, Japan, France, South Korea, Germany, Spain, and Australia. These demographic insights can be leveraged to optimize marketing strategies by providing relevant content or products tailored to users' needs.

- Despite a slight 0.5% increase in pageviews to 316,354, there was a significant 5.6% increase in bounce rate, suggesting that many website visitors only viewed one page before leaving.

- Both CTR and Goal Conversion Rate declined from the previous period. The potential reasons for this decrease could be attributed to various factors that require additional analysis. Seasonal trends, changes in content relevance or marketing strategies, user experience issues, increased competition, technical problems, and shifts in user behavior are among the aspects that should be further investigated to pinpoint the exact causes for the decline. Conducting in-depth data analysis and exploring user feedback will provide valuable insights for formulating actionable strategies to improve CTR and Goal Conversion Rate in future periods.

- The top page title in June was "Home" with 60,033 pageviews. Additionally, direct traffic and paid search were the primary sources through which visitors accessed the website.

Overall, these findings provide valuable insights for decision-making and optimization strategies. Further analysis is recommended to understand the factors influencing the declining metrics and to identify areas for improvement to enhance user engagement and goal conversion.
